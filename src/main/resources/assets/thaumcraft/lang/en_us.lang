research.Pech.stage.1=These strange humanoids can be found wherever the veil between worlds is at its thinnest. They seem drawn to the magical energies that abound in such places.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research5.png:128:136:108:117:.75</IMG>However, I should not let their small stature fool me. They have incredible strength and can carry many times their own bodyweight.<BR>Pech are normally not aggressive, but when riled up they will band together and hunt down their attacker. Under normal conditions they avoid people at all costs.<BR>Pechs are notoriously avaricious, and will loot anything not nailed down, though they prefer precious things. It is said that if one were to feed this desire for material wealth it could be possible to befriend one.<BR>Once befriended they often carry wondrous objects that they might be willing to part with.<BR>It should be noted that such 'friendships' seldom last long, though.
#
research.ThaumSlime.stage.1=These purple slimes are a strange offshoot of their green cousins. Normal slimes form from the organic gunk that occasionally collects in caves, but Thaumic Slimes are formed from the purple proto-matter residue left over from magical mishaps.<BR>Apart from their strange origins they are rather similar to their green cousins for the most part. They do appear to have the ability to split at will, often spitting a lesser version of themselves at targets that venture too close. If there are no targets nearby, split slimes will endeavour to reform to once again form a larger organism.
#
research.Firebat.stage.1=Fire bats, or Hellbats, are usually found in the Nether. Engulfed in flame and unreasonably aggressive they are perfectly suited to the environment they live in. They also have the alarming tendency to explode when attacking.<BR>One might wonder what possible evolutionary advantage exploding gives them as a species, but I suppose the same can be asked of creepers.
#
research.BrainyZombie.stage.1=I have observed that some zombies seem much more aware than their lumbering brethren. Their eyes burn with a malevolent intelligence leading me to believe that they retained much more intelligence after death than is normal. They are definitely more aggressive and dangerous than a normal zombie.<BR>They should make for a good source of brain matter for my experiments.
#
research.EldritchGuardian.stage.1=These ghost-like figures are a dangerous menace. They can be found wherever the walls of reality are at their thinnest. I believe they act as guardians of such places, protecting those weak spots from trespassers.<BR>Their form is held together by dimensional energies from some other place making them much weaker in our world. I would hate having to confront them in whatever place they call home.<BR>Their touch is deadly and they are able to hurl entropic dimensional energy at those too far to reach.
#
research.EldritchCrab.stage.1=Eldritch Crabs, or Helmed Crabs, are a most unusual and unnatural creature. I am convinced these creatures are the result of magical tinkering.<BR>A pair of powerful claws make them dangerous to face in combat, but it is how they use those claws that make them horrific. They leap at their foes heads in an attempt to decapitate them. If successful they are somehow able to burrow into the victims body and take control of what remains. Their abdomen looks much like a helmed head allowing them to disguise the true nature of the husk they now control.<BR>These husks are not much more powerful than a normal zombie so the reason why they do this eludes me - they are much more of a threat without their 'mount'. Possibly they were created as weapons of terror by some demented inventor?
#
research.CrimsonCultist.stage.1=These red-robed cultists have been popping up of late. Their goals are unknown to me and they seem unwilling to talk. Beyond that there is something... wrong about them. Their grip on sanity seems tenuous at best, but the wrongness goes much deeper than that. It is hard to describe.<BR>My presence seems to enrage them and I believe it might have something to do with my capacity for thaumaturgy.<BR>Their clerics are also capable of wielding magic and I can sense that they are drawing it from the aura, but the magic itself does not seem to be thaumaturgy. Whatever it is, it makes my skin crawl and I can feel the aura buckling and tearing every time they draw upon it.<BR>Some of them seem to carry a book around. I should try and get my hand on one of those, maybe it will tell me more about this strange cult. I should be careful though, some kinds of knowledge are far more dangerous than others.
#
research.TaintCrawler.stage.1=These disgusting grubs secrete corrupting Taint wherever they go. Most of the time the Taint is short-lived if they wander too far from the core of the Taint growth, but other times this can cause the Taint to spread much quicker than it normally would.<BR>I should destroy them on sight.
#
research.Taintacle.stage.1=These dangerous growths look like giant tentacles. They will lash out at anything that comes nearby.<BR>Though they are immobile, keeping my distance might not actually keep me safe as miniature versions of them can spawn all around me, should I draw their attention.
#
research.TaintSwarm.stage.1=Sometimes purple hive-like growths will form on the remains of trees within Taint. Swarms of tiny biting creatures will spawn from these growths and rove around in aggressive swarms.<BR>They move fast, are hard to avoid and even harder to hit. Fortunately the individual creatures are not particularly robust, so as long as I am properly prepared I should be able to dispatch them easily.
#
research.TaintSeed.stage.1=Occasionally tight knots of Tainted tendrils will form. From out of this 'seed' foul tainted air will spew which acts as the basis for new Taint growth.<BR>These seeds can lash out to defend themselves, but the risk must be taken if I wish to rid an area of taint.<BR>Without the foul air these seeds create, tainted growth soon withers and dies. 
#
research.PRIMPEARL.stage.1=For the first time I find myself with a puzzle that I do not think can be solved.<BR>This object contains pure primal aspects, but they possess properties unlike what I consider normal, everyday primal aspects. I have a few theories why this could be:<BR>Firstly this "pearl" could be the remnants of primal matter that was created at the dawn of reality - elementary magic that existed before it mingled and merged into compound aspects.<BR>Alternatively it could be primal matter from a place that does not conform to the known rules of magic as I have come to understand them. I'm not sure which explanation is more worrying.<BR>Either way, the pearl is a potent artifact containing vast magical power and nearly unlimited potential.<BR>It is fairly rare to find a whole one though. Often they have degenerated into nodules or even motes. Even a mote is valuable though.
#
research.KNOWLEDGETYPES.stage.1=There are two main types of knowledge: Observations and Theories. They are further subdivided into the main research categories like Alchemy and Artifice.<LINE>§lObservations§r are notes and discoveries I have made in the real world by scanning objects. Practical observation often give insights into how things work and by keeping field notes of those observations I will slowly build a solid base of knowledge to work from.<LINE>§lTheories§r, in a nutshell, are ways of understanding things through careful observation, rational thought and practical experimentation. Much of thaumaturgical research requires crafting theories to better understand research categories.
#
research.THEORYRESEARCH.stage.2=Now that I have a workspace I should start performing some research. I can now formulate theories on how to manipulate magic to my own ends.<BR>Firstly I should make sure the table has plenty of paper and I have ample ink for my scribing tools. I can now choose to start researching the theory.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research1.png:0:0:128:96:1</IMG>At the top of the page I will see how much inspiration (represented by light bulbs) is available to me for this round of research. When I do a stack of papers will appear on the left. If I select them I will be given the choice of two research paths I can follow. Each route will state what knowledge it will grant me, divided between one or more research categories.<BR>Some of the choices will require items. Items marked with a golden §6!§r will be consumed if the card is chosen.<BR>Normally I will only be able to pursue research categories that I have unlocked, though I am sure I might occasionally be able to discover completely new avenues of research.<BR>I can keep drawing to further my knowledge. I should note however that each choice I make will cost some of my inspiration. Once I run out the research will be completed. The amount of initial inspiration available to me will increase as my knowledge of magic increases.<BR>My progress in research categories is shown as a percentage - 100% completion represents 1 full theory. Getting less than 100% in a category still counts however and will be added to my current knowledge once I complete my research. It is possible to get more than 100% in a category. Only the highest category will get the full bonus however, all others will lose 33% of their total.<BR><PAGE>§nResearch Aids§r<BR>Normally research is a bit scattershot. I can direct my research with the use of research aids. If I use certain nearby blocks, items and curios during the research process it will allow me to focus my research in a certain direction.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research1.png:128:0:128:96:1</IMG>For example having access to a bookshelf will give me reference materials that I can use during the research process. These come in the form of limited special draws that have a higher chance of occurring than normal draws. These will have a gilded border to differentiate them from normal draws. For example the bookshelf grants the Balance research option and two chances at the Notation research option that can only be gained when I use the bookshelf.<BR>When I start my initial research I can choose which research aids to use, but it should be noted that each aid I use reduces my initial inspiration by one.<BR>There are potentially a lot of things that could be used as research aids, so I should experiment.
#
research.UNLOCKAUROMANCY.stage.2=Slowly but surely I am beginning to understand the nature of Vis. So much is still hidden to me, but I think I now know enough to begin moulding it to my will. For this I will need a tool. A very special tool.<BR>I have stumbled upon some dusty scrolls penned by a long dead thaumaturge. It describes how to craft wands that are used to store and channel vis. The insights I learned from the scrolls were useful, but the application seems so limiting. Why trap vis in a wand when it is all around me? Even the wand itself seems impractical to me. If I need something to grasp and shape the aura it should be something appropriate. Something like a glove.<BR>Any old glove will not do - it will need to be handcrafted from the finest leather and laced with vis conductive materials. Iron is a poor vis conductor, but it is all I have available to me at this time.<BR>Luckily there will be no mucking about with magical woods and so forth to store the vis, but I will need some way of channeling vis directly from the aura - a vis resonator if I will. I will also attach a stripped-down thaumometer to the glove so I can monitor the local aura.<BR>Lastly I will place a receptacle on the back of the glove. The scrolls mentioned using special crystalline foci to channel the vis from the wands. Their crystalline lattice shapes the vis into different configurations to create all manner of useful effects. Brilliant actually. It irks me that I did not think of it first. Fortunately I have already thought of several ways to improve on the design and the shape of the glove lends itself on manipulating the flow of vis much more than the old style wands could.  
research.UNLOCKAUROMANCY.stage.3=I have managed to put together a basic casting gauntlet and I am quite pleased with the result. It is still a bit rough, but that is to be expected from a prototype. Even as a prototype it will prove useful, allowing me to make delicate adjustments or alterations to thaumaturgical devices and safely manipulate them in all manner of ways.<BR>My initial experiments have shown that it is only able to draw vis from a relatively small area around me. I should be careful not to deplete the aura.<BR>My main stumbling block now is that in its current state it is little more than a magical wrench. Until I crack the secret of crafting foci its utility will be limited. The path before me is clear...
#
research.UNLOCKARTIFICE.stage.1=I have learned much and one of those things is how much more I still have to learn. The worlds revealed to me are arcane and mysterious with many invisible wonders... and dangers.<BR>I need a tool that will allow me to see the unseen and ease my journey of discovery. The old texts I have read make mention of a set of goggles commonly used by thaumaturges for just this purpose.<BR>Alas, the text does not mention exactly how they work, so I will need to design my own from first principles.
research.UNLOCKARTIFICE.stage.2=I have penned my own designs based on the little information I could find and my own experimental findings. Time to put theory into practice.<BR>Not only will the goggles reveal hidden things, but they will also reduce the vis cost of certain thaumaturgical tasks.<BR>Lastly these goggles will allow me to see the vis or essentia content of objects in the world, which will prove a great boon I am sure.<PAGE>The most important thing I have learned however is the possibility of crafting delicate mechanical devices using magic and imbuing them with arcane power. 
#
research.UNLOCKALCHEMY.stage.3=I have my crucible! Now I need something to experiment with, and I happen to have the perfect thing. I have spent many a late-night studying thaumaturgy and flickering torchlight is not the best thing to read by. A steady magical light is exactly what I need now.<BR>Glowstone is a steady source of light, but I require large handfuls of it for a light source and it lacks... style. I am sure I can alter it into something better.<BR>The crucible needs to be placed over a source of heat and filled with water. Once the water boils I can start adding the things I need. I have jotted down a recipe that I think will create a substance I have named Nitor. A small core of energized glowstone empowered with energy, fire and light should burn forever. It should be naturally buoyant, allowing it to be placed wherever I choose - even floating in mid-air.<BR>I simply need to find objects with the required essentia (pressing shift whilst hovering over an item might help here) and throw them into the crucible.<BR>The crucible will render them down into their constituent essentia. I might not be able to gather the exact combination of essentia I require, but if there are enough of the types I need everything should be fine.<BR>Once I have enough all I need to do is throw in the catalyst. In this case a handful of glowstone dust.<BR>If all goes well the glowstone will absorb the essentia and transform into nitor.<BR>I am not sure what will happen to the excess essentia, but I can only assume it will eventually dissolve harmlessly.<BR>Shift-right clicking with an empty hand will empty a crucible. Each crafting operation will consume some of the water so I will have to replenish it now and again.
#
research.FLUX.stage.2=Note to self: Do NOT let the flux build. It is bad.<BR>Very, very bad.<BR>If Flux builds high enough it seem to cause a tear in the very fabric of magic itself. The flux escapes through this tear, but raw, chaotic magic spills back into our world causing all manner of calamity.<BR>I should be a lot more careful of causing flux in the future. In fact, I should start looking into ways to neutralise Flux.
#
research.WARP.warn=Your mind reels from the knowledge you have gained
research.WARP.stage.1=Many believe mankind was not meant to meddle with magic, and nothing gives more credence to this than the existence of Warp.<BR>Researching forbidden magics or crafting objects of a questionable nature tends to distort a thaumaturge's view of reality, twisting both their mind and their body. This effect is called Warp.<BR>While some Warp gained is temporary and will fade over time, there is no known way to get rid of permanent Warp once it is gained and the thaumaturge who chooses to ignore the dangers in the pursuit of power often finds themself on a slippery slope.<BR>Warp usually manifests as minor lapses in concentration, physical pain or hallucinations.<BR>These are more than merely mental though, as the visions sometimes impart useful knowledge or apparent hallucinations prove to be frighteningly real.<BR>I should monitor my mental wellbeing carefully; to that end I have designed a device that should show me exactly how even my keel is at the moment.
#
research.ORE.amber=§oAmber Ore§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research3.png:0:128:128:128:.6</IMG>This ore is found near the surface and when mined drops chunks of amber. If I am lucky, it may even drop some rarer materials too.
research.ORE.crystal=§oVis Crystals§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research4.png:0:0:128:128:.6</IMG>On occasion there is so much primal energy in the aura that it will settle into rock from which vis infused crystals will grow. As long as they are fed vis they will continue to grow and even spread.<BR>Once the aura dips low enough the energy once again dissipates out of the crystals, replenishing the aura and causing the crystals to crumble. In effect, they are natural, or in this case, supernatural vis batteries. They will never crumble away completely and at least a small remnant of the crystal will remain.<BR>These crystals can be harvested for elemental shards that have many uses in Thaumaturgy.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research3.png:0:104:96:16:1</IMG>I have yet to discover a method to extract individual crystals without destroying the entire cluster. It is a matter of all or none.<BR>Vis crystals growing in tainted areas may become tainted as well.
#
research.PLANTS.silverwood=§oSilverwood§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research4.png:0:128:128:128:.6</IMG>These rare and magical trees are a wondrous sight. Their leaves shimmer with magical energy and their pale, soft wood is valued for its purifying properties.<BR>The tree's magical nature is such that if allowed to grow naturally they will slowly replenish the aura around them - this feature alone makes a silverwood sapling a rare prize.
research.PLANTS.greatwood=§oGreatwood§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research4.png:128:128:128:128:.6</IMG>These large and majestic trees can be found dotted all over the countryside.<BR>Their wood is able to absorb impressive amounts of magic making it a useful component in the creation of magical devices.
research.PLANTS.cinderpearl=§oCinderpearls§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research5.png:0:0:128:128:.6</IMG>Found only in the hottest of climes, these plants burn with elemental fire. They can be harvested and ground to produce a fine powder nigh-identical to Blaze powder.
research.PLANTS.vishroom=§oVishroom§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research5.png:0:128:128:128:.6</IMG>This strange, glowing mushroom can only be found growing in magical forests.<BR>They have hallucinogenic properties so one must be careful not to approach them too closely.
#
research.CRYSTALFARMER.stage.2=I have found a way to reinvigorate vis crystals in such a way that I can replant them.<BR>With luck this should mean I can grow my own steady supply of primal vis crystals.
#
research.FLUXCLEANUP.stage.1=I... §omay§r have made a mess of things. I have allowed flux to build up in the aura and now I need to get rid of it - fast.<BR>Fortunately the answer might be found in one of the unique properties of flux. Technically flux is just 'dirty' vis, but what sets it apart is the fact that it can easily transform from a form of energy into physical matter. This makes it dangerous as it can spawn Taint and other forms of nastiness, but maybe it can also be coaxed into safer forms.
research.FLUXCLEANUP.stage.2=I have managed to find a way of turn pure Flux in the aura into flux essentia. Flux essentia is hardly benign, but it is much easier to handle than raw Flux. Unfortunately the process is not simple, cheap, or fast.<BR>I have drawn up plans for a Flux Condenser. When supplied with lots of essentia it can draw flux from the aura and force it to become essentia itself. Every point of flux drawn from the aura will require 5 or more essentia and some time. The type of essentia does not matter as long as I do not use Flux essentia. That would be bad.<BR>Essentia can be piped into the sides of the Condenser and the resulting flux essentia can be drained from the bottom.<LINE>The Condenser is not all that is needed. I also need a special lattice that will actually draw the flux from the aura. The lattice pieces can be connected to the top of the Condenser and each other to form a multiblock structure. The more pieces I connect, the quicker the Condenser can draw flux from the aura. It does however increase the essentia cost.<BR>The lattice cannot be attached any old way however:<BR>1) The lattice blocks must be attached to the top of the condenser and all the connected lattice pieces must be above the condenser itself.<BR>2) I can attach many lattice blocks together, but any lattice pieces further than 8 blocks from the condenser will automatically detach.<BR>3) It is theoretically possibly to pack a large amount of lattice pieces into this 8 block range, but the benefit a lattice piece provides is reduced for each other lattice piece it is connected to.<BR>4) It may appear that a single unbroken line of lattices would be the best configuration, but occasionally the filter in a lattice piece becomes clogged and unusable. All lattice pieces after the clogged one will no longer aid the conversion speed, though they will still add to the cost. The filter can be replaced by clicking on the clogged lattice piece with a fresh one.<BR>To determine the cost and conversion rate of the Condenser multiblock I can simply use an Essentia Resonator on the Condenser itself.
#
research.FLUXRIFT.stage.1=As I suspected these tears are holes in reality itself. The chaotic energies that flow from them is extremely dangerous and I should find a way to close these rifts as soon as possible.<BR>My observations of the rift itself have revealed some interesting things, however. The rifts actually seem to feed on flux - the more flux there is in the environment, the larger they grow. They also grow more unstable over time and eventually this instability causes a burst of pure chaotic energy. This energy can take many forms and is seldom a good thing. Fortunately, they regain some stability when this happens. The severity of the chaos burst depends on the size of the rift.<BR>Even though I can't close them yet, maybe I can find some way of keeping them stable.
#
research.RIFTCLOSER.stage.2=I have studied the chaotic energies that form these flux rifts and have made an interesting discovery: The rifts themselves are inherently unstable. In theory they will close naturally should they become unstable enough, but the laws of our reality makes this highly unlikely - instead their unstable energy is usually released in smaller bursts. That is probably a good thing - the amount of energy that will be released should a fully unstable rift collapse would be catastrophic.<BR>I think that I have worked out a way to trigger that collapse without the rift needing to be fully unstable - in short, I plan on blowing them up.<BR>No normal explosive will do however - I need an explosive that sends its destructive energies into more than the three normal dimensions. To this end I have designed an explosive I have named the Causality Collapser. This pulsing red sphere needs to be thrown as close to the rift as possible. In theory it will break down the chaotic energies holding the rift together.<BR>Unfortunately my calculations suggest that while collapsing the rift will release large amounts of unstable primal energy - the more unstable the rift, the more chaotic this release will be. I should somehow try to make the rift as stable as possible before detonating the explosive.

# ALCHEMY
##########################################
#
research.BASEALCHEMY.stage.1=Crucible crafting guide<BR>1) Place crucible over heat source (fire, lava, nitor or something similar).<BR>2) Add water and wait till it boils.<BR>3) Add ingredients that contain the essentia I require, either by dropping them in or clicking with the item on the crucible's top face<BR>4) Throw in catalyst.<PAGE>Things to note<BR>- Shift-right clicking with an empty hand will empty a crucible.<BR>- Each crafting operation will consume some of the water so I will have to replenish it now and again. Piping mechanics can be used for this.<BR>- I can craft multiple items at once by adding sufficient essentia and using multiple catalysts.<BR>- Essentia does dissolve over time so I shouldn't wait too long before starting to craft. I wonder what the purple puffs of smoke means when this happens? Probably nothing to worry about.<LINE>§oCrafting Crystals§r<BR>Essentia crystals should be fairly easy to craft. All I need to do is break down a quartz crystal into smaller shards to act as a growth medium.<BR>Simply dipping a shard into the crucible should soak up some of the essentia it contains and cause the crystal to grow.<BR>This won't be a particularly efficient way of doing things - it will probably cost at least twice the essentia that the crystal will end up containing and there is the net loss of quartz which is not always the easiest thing to find.
#
research.ALUMENTUM.stage.1=Nitor is a useful substance. It provides heat, light and is aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately it provides only slightly more heat than a torch - enough to slowly heat some water or keep me warm at night, but not enough for practical purposes like smelting ore.<BR>I need something more... reactive.<BR>I should take some time to collect my thoughts and study the elements. Maybe there is a way to improve coal like I did glowstone.
#
research.METALLURGY.stage.1=Brass is a sturdy, low friction metal perfectly suited to craft intricate mechanical devices.<BR>Unfortunately, it is not always possible to get hold of it due to the morphic properties of the universe I may find myself in.<BR>There should be a way of crafting it via alchemical transmutation; I simply need to find it.
research.METALLURGY.stage.2=Metals have proven to be quite easy to manipulate via thaumaturgical principles. My first experiments have led to the discovery of Alchemical Brass, but it was a simple matter to create something that I knew already existed. It is time to create something new.<BR>I have theorized that by infusing a base metal like iron with magical energy should result in something with very interesting properties.<BR> It should be harder than iron with the ability to accept enchantments beyond that which iron is normally capable of.<BR>A metal such as this should have many applications in the crafting of more advanced thaumaturgical devices.
research.METALLURGY.stage.3=For now my metallurgic studies are complete, but who knows what other wondrous discoveries I will make in the future?
#
research.METALPURIFICATION.stage.2=I have formulated an alchemical recipe to purify metal ores into native clusters, as I was hoping. As mentioned previously, smelting these produces twice the number of ingots than a regular piece of ore - this should help me avoid continually delving into the depths on mining expeditions. The recipe itself is versatile, and should work for many kinds of metal ore if I have access to them.
#
research.HEDGEALCHEMY.stage.3=Some things I simply have to craft from scratch - all I need is a base material to add essentia to and with a bit of luck I can manufacture a few relatively common, but annoying to get materials.
research.HEDGEALCHEMY.stage.4=For now my alchemical studies are complete, but who knows what other wondrous discoveries I will make in the future?
#
research.LIQUIDDEATH.stage.1=Curiosity has taken me down a dark path. I wonder what a liquid made mostly from entropic and death energy would do. Nothing good I imagine.<BR>At the very least it should make a handy weed killer, or help with pest control.
research.LIQUIDDEATH.stage.2=Oh dear, what have I done? This liquid is so dangerously toxic that virtually nothing can prevent it from dissolving flesh, bone and even harder substances. Nothing alive or that even displays the semblance of life can survive it.<BR>Apart from obvious practical applications, this vile substance has another interesting property: any essentia a dissolved creature possessed reforms into essentia crystals that can be harvested.
#
research.BOTTLETAINT.stage.1=I should be able to replicate the Taint causing properties of flux. I am not exactly sure why I would want to, but sometimes progress requires risk.<BR>The process should be fairly simple - I merely need to create a concentrated mixture of flux and it should easily react with almost anything to create Taint. It likely won't last long outside the presence of a Flux Seed, however, though ultimately this may be for the better.
#
research.BATHSALTS.stage.1=Warp is a danger for even the most careful of thaumaturges. For those that have done a bit too much dabbling, Warp effects are probably more than just an annoyance.<BR>I should make solving this problem a priority. Even if I am not able to remove Warp, at the very least I should be able to alleviate its detrimental effects.
research.BATHSALTS.stage.2=I have drawn up a recipe to create relaxing and refreshing bath salts. Simply tossing these salts into water will turn the water into a silvery, purifying liquid that soothes away the stresses of the day and brings temporary relief from the effects of Warp. I should note, however, that the more warp a thaumaturge suffers from, the shorter the duration of this protection will be.<BR>As a final note: the salts are quite fragile and thus will quickly dissolve if I toss them around haphazardly.
#
research.SANESOAP.stage.1=I seem to have stumbled upon something here. Bath Salts relax the body and brings temporary relief from Warp, but I need a more permanent solution. Something that will cleanse my body of Warp completely.<BR>Sympathetic magic could come in handy here. Soap cleanses the body, but with the proper amount of persuasion perhaps it can cleanse the mind as well?
research.SANESOAP.stage.2=Eureka! I have formulated a recipe for what I have named Sanity Soap (patent pending).<BR>This soap cleans the flesh, but the effects it has on the psyche are what truly makes it special. When used it will cleanse the mind of all temporary warp, with a small chance of reducing non-permanent warp.<BR>Using it while under the effects of a Warp Ward or while standing in Purifying Fluid will further increase the odds of non-permanent warp mitigation.
#
research.ARCANESPA.stage.2=I have created a handy machine that, when filled with water and bath salts, will automatically mix them and pump the liquid into an area just above it. The liquid will fill a 5x5 area above the location where the machine is placed.<BR>Additionally, I have designed it in such a way that it can be used to pump nearly any liquid I can fill it with. It can be filled with automation, or by clicking on the block with the appropriate container. Applying a redstone signal will disable it.
#
research.WARDEDJARS.title=Warded Jars & Labels
research.WARDEDJARS.stage.1=Essentia can be stored in §lWarded Jars§r.<BR>Warded jars can be placed in the world and are able to store essentia virtually indefinitely. The enchantment placed on the jars also makes adding or extracting essentia a breeze.<BR>Jars can be filled from an alembic by clicking with the jar directly on the alembic. They can also be filled and emptied using phials.<BR>What is more they make an excellent storage medium for jams and preserves.<BR>Shift clicking on jars and alembics with an empty hand will empty them.<PAGE>As long as a jar contains some essentia, I can attach a §lJar Label§r to it.<BR>This label will 'lock' the jar to that type of essentia and it will not be able to accept any other kind of essentia.<BR>I can remove a label by shift clicking with an empty hand on the side of the jar containing the label. I must take care not to shift click on any other side as this §owill§r empty the jar as normal.<BR>I can also place a label in a crafting bench with a phial of essentia to assign an aspect to it, and when placed on an empty jar it will automatically lock the jar to that aspect. The essentia used in the recipe is not consumed.<BR>Placing it on a filled jar will change the label to the jar's essentia type.<BR>A label can be made blank again by simply placing it by itself in a crafting grid.<PAGE>I can also craft §lBrass Lid Braces§r. When used on a jar, it will prevent essentia being drawn from or placed into the jar by anything other than tubes.<BR>Picking up the jar will remove the brace and return it as an item.
#
research.ESSENTIASMELTER.stage.1=I see a time fast approaching where I will need to have ready access to multiple different kinds of essentia. For that I will need a source and the most obvious is the essentia found in, well, everything.<BR>Using alchemical principles, I should be able to find a way to break down objects and convert them into essentia. Before I can start, however, I will need to study essentia in the purest form available to me - vis crystals.<BR>By subjecting these crystals to, um, "destructive testing" I should be able to determine how they react in various extremes and the best way to preserve their purity.<BR>I should start with primal Essentia.
research.ESSENTIASMELTER.stage.2=My experiments are promising, if a bit unpredictable. Fortunately, fires are easily quenched and hair grows back more than quickly enough.<BR>It seems melting objects down in a special alchemical process is my best option. Unfortunately, my tests so far have been on primal crystals. I should also test my finding on crystals containing secondary essentia - that is essentia made up of a combination of two primal aspects.<BR>A third tier known as tertiary essentia also exists. That is essentia made up of a mixture of primal and secondary aspects, or two secondary aspects.
research.ESSENTIASMELTER.stage.3=I have managed to break down all my samples of primary and secondary essentia into a liquid state. The process has been slow and tedious, however. Until I simplify the process it will never be practical for large scale usage.<BR>Luckily extracting essentia from objects has a lot in common with the smelting of metals. Using a furnace as a base I might be able to create an essentia smeltery that automatically melts down items and separates out individual types of essentia.
#
research.ESSENTIASMELTERTHAUMIUM.stage.1=The basic essentia smelter is quite crude, if I must be honest with myself; it is extremely inefficient and rather slow, to which I chalk up to the low quality of the materials it is crafted from.<BR>I believe Thaumium could prove useful in improving the smelting process, I should run some experiments to see how effective it would be at containing essentia slurry.<BR>I should probably also improve the plumbing inside the smelter itself. 
research.ESSENTIASMELTERTHAUMIUM.stage.2=Thaumium has proven to be a good choice, though not quite as effective as I had hoped.<BR>The Thaumium Smeltery works much like the basic smeltery, but it has roughly 90% efficiency instead of 80%. Not quite the improvement I was hoping for, but good enough I suppose.<BR>However, its main benefit is that it breaks down essentia slurry at double the speed of the old smeltery.
#
research.ESSENTIASMELTERVOID.stage.1=I need to go back to the drawing board. Using Thaumium did improve the smelting process, but not to the degree I had hoped.<BR>My recent discovery of Void Metal has opened up a new avenue of research for me; it is much more resilient and malleable than Thaumium. I should put it through the same battery of tests I did for Thaumium and see how the two compare.<BR>It might also be worth changing the internal plumbing once again to incorporate Void Metal in some manner.
#
research.THAUMATORIUM.stage.2=I have invented an automated device I have named the Thaumatorium. Like many multi-part devices this one must be created using Salis Mundus.<BR>The Thaumatorium is a marvelous invention that allows a thaumaturge to select which formula to use from an input catalyst. It then automatically draws essentia from available sources using tubes. As long as there is a supply of the catalyst, it produces the required object perfectly, every time.<BR>The crucible that forms its base does not require water, but a heat source is still needed.<LINE>When I access the device there are several slots. The top-left slot is where I place the catalyst. Once I have done this, I can choose which recipe I wish to craft with that catalyst from a list of possibilities that appear below it.<BR>On the right will be shown the essentia required, in the order they will be consumed. It will also display progress bars once the machine is in operation.<BR>The created object is ejected out the front of the device or into an inventory placed in front of the ejection port.<LINE>Normally a Thaumatorium can only have one active formula, but by attaching a Mnemonic Matrix to its side I can increase the number of formulas it can keep track of. Each matrix increases the number of formulas by 2.
#
research.ESSENTIATRANSPORT.stage.1=During the infusion crafting process essentia is drawn directly from jars and floats through the air toward the infusion matrix. The magic of the matrix keeps it stable enough for the infusion process, but normally the essentia is changed in such a way that it becomes unusable for anything else.<BR>Perhaps I can find a way to draw essentia through the air outside of the infusion process and still keep it stable.
#
research.CENTRIFUGE.stage.1=I often find myself with complex essentia I have no real need for. I need to find a way to put all that unused essentia to a practical use. Perhaps I can break it down into its component essentia?
#
research.TUBES.stage.2=I have unlocked the key to creating stable and relatively leak-free tubing. While mundane chemicals can be transported in glass, certain types of essentia either dissolve or simply pass right through it. By wrapping the glass in iron and treating it with quicksilver I have managed to protect it from even the most volatile types of essentia. Brass fittings finish off the piping system and makes it visually appealing.<PAGE>The tubes can be connected to all manner of alchemical devices, though warded jars and alembics are their primary targets.<BR>Essentia flows through the tubes whenever something is connected to them that can accept it, like warded jars.<BR>Jars containing different kinds of essentia will only draw their kind of essentia towards them. Tubes however can only draw and transport one kind of essentia at a time - the highest drawing strength will take priority. Without the proper use of valves it is quite easy for a network of tubes to get gummed up. The use of valves is essential.<BR>When I see gases being vented from a tube, it means different kinds of suction are interfering with each other. The color of the gas gives a clue as to the types of suction that is causing the problem.<LINE>Tubes can be connected and disconnected from their neighbors by clicking on a section of tubing with a Caster.<BR>The Caster can also be used to click on the central section to rotate certain tubes like the valve.<PAGE><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/items/resonator.png:0:0:255:255:.125</IMG>The Essentia Resonator is handy for troubleshooting my tube network. I can use it on a tube or other essentia using device to see what essentia it currently contains and the suction it is applying.<PAGE><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/items/tube_valve.png:0:0:255:255:.125</IMG>The essentia valve acts much like a normal length of tubing, except it can be turned off by hand or with a redstone signal. When this is done the flow of essentia through it will be cut off.<PAGE><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/items/tube_filter.png:0:0:255:255:.125</IMG>Filtered essentia tubes work like normal tubes, except it is possible to mark them with labels, phials or other items that clearly identify a single type of essentia. When marked they will restrict essentia flow through them to what they have been marked with.<BR>Shift-clicking on them with an empty hand will remove the filter.<PAGE><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/items/tube_restrict.png:0:0:255:255:.125</IMG>Restricted essentia tubes work like normal tubes, except they halve the any suction passing through them.<PAGE><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/items/tube_oneway.png:0:0:255:255:.125</IMG>Directional essentia tubes only accept suction from one direction. The blue markings indicate the direction from which suction will be accepted.<PAGE><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/items/tube_buffer.png:0:0:255:255:.125</IMG>The essentia buffer allows me to store a limited amount of essentia - 8 points total, though it can be made up of any combination of essentia types. Like a jar it has suction, though it applies the minimum amount of suction possible (1).<BR>This means that is usually only able to draw essentia from an essentia source it is directly attached to. However tubes can be connected to all its sides, meaning that it is invaluable for getting essentia out of devices that could contain variable types of essentia.<BR>I can attach bellows to the buffer - each attached bellows increases its suction by 32.<BR>Additionally I can toggle individual connections on and off as with a normal tube, but if I shift click a connection, it will choke the suction back to 1 (blue band) or 0 (red band) on that side.<BR>This allows for some interesting possibilities when routing essentia.
#
research.EVERFULLURN.stage.1=Alchemical creation has proven to be much easier than I expected. However, if I can somehow help automate this process by creating something simple and practical it will go a long way toward further alchemical breakthroughs.<BR>Maybe something like an infinite water source would be a good start?
#
research.POTIONSPRAYER.stage.1=I have made some initial tests to replicate the ordinary potion crafting process using essentia. My results have been mixed.<BR>I should focus my efforts to make it work.
research.POTIONSPRAYER.stage.2=This has been an effort in frustration, but I have managed to salvage some success from the jaws of failure. I can indeed replicate the magical effects of a potion by combining the essentia it contains, but the result is extremely volatile. There is no way to simply decant the results into a potion bottle - at least none that I have found so far.<BR>The volatile substance immediately dissipates when exposed to air, but it can still transfer the magical effects to anything nearby, much like splash potion.<BR>I have crafted something that I am calling a Potion Sprayer. I can supply it with a potion that acts as a template and then provide it with the correct types of essentia. The sprayer will then manufacture a dose of the potion and store it internally. I can store up to 8 such doses.<BR>When it receives a redstone signal it will emit a single dose of the potion in a 3x3x3 area in front of it.

##########################################
# INFUSION
##########################################
#
research.BASEINFUSION.stage.1=I am now ready to begin crafting enchanted objects and tools.<LINE>I have drawn up designs for some banners to decorate my lab, similar to mundane ones but with a Thaumaturgic twist - I can apply a phial of essentia to them to have them display that essentia symbol.
#
research.INFUSION.stage.1=Arcane crafting and alchemy can go only so far. Something better is needed to create truly powerful mystical objects.<BR>I believe that it should be possible to infuse objects with essentia directly. One could, for example, infuse a stone with §6Aer§0 vis and a feather and it would result in a very light stone.<BR>Or at least, that's the theory.
research.INFUSION.stage.3=To even get started with infusion crafting there are several things I will need: The Runic Matrix (which I now have), arcane pedestals and a ready supply of magic in the form of essentia.<BR>Once I have my Runic Matrix properly placed into a structure known as an Infusion Altar, I can begin to craft with it. The altar is crafted with the use of Salis Mundus, like most other mystical structures. Once the pillars have formed, the runic matrix can be activated using a Caster's Gauntlet.<BR>The central pedestal located under the matrix is where the item I wish to infuse will go. I will also need several more pedestals placed around the altar, on which I can place the blocks and items I wish to infuse into the target object. Lastly, I will need warded jars or similar essentia containers holding the requisite amounts of essentia.<BR>Once all this is gathered I can right-click on the Runic Matrix with a caster's gauntlet to start the crafting process.<BR>During the first stage of crafting, essentia will be drained from nearby sources. Crafting will stall if there is insufficient essentia available - something not good for reasons I will explain on following pages.<BR>Once all the required essentia has been infused into the target object, the other objects will then have their essential essence drained. Only when this is done will the crafting process complete.<LINE>Infusion crafting is not without risks. The entire process involves forcing vast energies into a single object. Unpredictable things tend to happen.<BR>For instance, one of the infusion objects might get knocked off a pedestal, or flux could get generated, but more catastrophic events are also possible.<BR>The longer crafting continues due to unresolved problems like lack of vis or dropped items, the greater the chance of something bad happening.<BR>These effects can be reduced by various means. Firstly I must keep the entire fusion structure as symmetrical as possible - I should take careful note of where I place pedestals and ensure they are balanced with other pedestals on the opposite side of the altar. When placing infusion items onto pedestals I should keep their placement balanced as well. Lastly, placing occult paraphernalia around the altar in symmetrical formations (things like candles, skulls, etc.) also helps by mitigating instability.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research5.png:128:0:128:136:1</IMG>
#
research.INFUSIONSTABLE.stage.1=Infusion has proven to be much more unstable than I expected. Placing occult paraphernalia does mitigate the effect somewhat, but much less than the texts suggested. The more items of the same type one places, the less effective they are.<BR>I need to find more effective ways of mitigating instability. Strangely enough, I think mundane technology might have the answer.<BR>It is well known that mundane power sources like redstone interferes with thaumaturgy. Of course, throwing redstone into the mix of an already unstable infusion is not the answer, but maybe there is some way to harness the interference.
research.INFUSIONSTABLE.stage.2=I have put together something I am calling, appropriately enough, a Stabilizer.<BR>The core of the Stabilizer is made from a block of redstone that has been bombarded by vis. As a result it has become an instability magnet of sorts. Unstable magical energy is drawn to it and discharged as flux. While not ideal, flux is easier to manage than losing expensive crafting ingredients.<BR>While Stabilizers provide a fair amount of stability to the infusion process when placed near the altar, they have a much more important function: When discharges occur that would normally knock items off their pedestals or even destroy them, the discharge can instead be redirected to the Stabilizer and absorbed.<BR>Unfortunately the Stabilizer needs a little help to perform this function. Pedestals I wish to protect need to be connected to the Stabilizer via Redstone Inlay. This is placed much like normal redstone and even has similar limits as redstone. For example the protective charge created by the Stabilizer cannot reach more than 15 blocks. Pedestals themselves act as redstone inlay and will propagate the protective charge. A properly connected pedestal will have runes appear at its base.<BR>When an instability discharge hits a protected pedestal, the discharge will travel along the inlay towards the nearest Stabilizer and discharge there instead. This temporarily weakens the stabilizer and the protective charge will be reduced till the Stabilizer has had a chance to discharge the unstable energy as flux. I may wish to use multiple stabilizers to prevent overloading a single one and leaving some pedestals temporarily unprotected.<BR>It should be noted that Redstone Inlay provide a small amount of stability themselves, so I should take care to keep their placement properly balanced.
got.instability=You should study infusion instability further.
#
research.INFUSIONANCIENT.stage.2=When this ancient stone is used to craft the pillars for an infusion altar, it will help reduce the amount of essentia required during infusion crafting and speed up the crafting process by a small amount. It will however increase instability slightly.<BR>If I find pedestals crafted from the same material, each one will also help reduce essentia costs.
#
research.INFUSIONELDRITCH.stage.1=The dark, eldritch stone I have discovered has some strange properties that may prove useful when used in an infusion altar.
research.INFUSIONELDRITCH.stage.2=I can now use this eldritch stone to used to craft the infusion altar pillars, which will help reduce instability and speed up the crafting process by a moderate amount. Unfortunately, this will increase crafting costs slightly.<BR>Pedestals made from the same material will also have the same effect. Caution should be taken to carefully balance them however as unbalanced eldritch pedestals will massively increase the instability of an altar.
#
research.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.stage.2=I have cracked the problem and should now be able to add infusion enchantments to most tools or weapons. Some enchantments can be applied multiple times to the same item, but each rank has an increased essentia cost when crafted.<BR>Each different infusion enchantment on the item also increases the cost by 33% and has an increased chance of giving it the Warping property.<BR>Certain infusion enchantments can only be applied to specific tools or weapons. This will be listed under each individual entry that follows.<BR>Tools with infusion enchantments can still be enchanted with the normal enchanting table and visa versa.<BR>Like with the elemental tools, sneaking while using an infusion enchanted tool will suppress its abilities.<PAGE>§oCollector§r<DIV>Whenever this tool harvests an item it will automatically float towards me.<DIV>§oRanks§r: none<BR>§oTarget§r: axe, pickaxe, shovel, weapon<PAGE>§oBurrowing§r<DIV>When I try to harvest a tree or ore the furthest block will be harvested first, instead of the one I was trying to break.<DIV>§oRanks§r: none<BR>§oTarget§r: axe, pickaxe<PAGE>§oRefining§r<DIV>Whenever I harvest ore there is a chance of gaining a native cluster instead. Increasing the rank of the enchant will improve the chance.<DIV>§oRanks§r: 1-4<BR>§oTarget§r: pickaxe<PAGE>§oSounding§r<DIV>I can sneak + right click on a block with this tool to send out a sounding pulse.

#
research.BOOTSTRAVELLER.stage.2=I have designed a pair of enchanted boots that will ease the journey of any traveler.<BR>They will allow one to move faster, jump higher and fall further.<BR>Lastly they will allow me to cut through water like a fish. A slow and clumsy fish, but a fish nonetheless.<BR>This power does have a cost however - the boots need to be charged with vis for their abilities to function.
#
research.PAVINGSTONES.stage.2=<PAGE>§oPaving Stone of Travel§r<DIV>By altering the magical structure of arcane stone I am able to create a paving stone that adds new bounce to the step of anyone walking across it.<BR>Anything walking across it will have greater speed and agility for a couple of seconds.<PAGE>§oBarrier Stone§r<DIV>I have discovered a way of turning arcane stone blocks into mystical wards that will prevent most creatures from crossing them.<BR>It should be noted that these wards aren't always 100% foolproof and they cannot prevent other players from entering an area, but they keep most common threats at bay. They will also prevent golems from crossing them.<BR>For best results I need an unbroken line of them between the areas I wish to protect and the outside world.<BR>An active redstone signal will disable this block.<BR>The color of the runes above the stone indicates its current status.<BR>Purple runes show that it is currently preventing something from passing through.<BR>Blue runes indicates it has been deactivated with a redstone signal.<BR>Red runes shows that something is preventing it from fully warding an area and a gap exists where something might be able to pass through.
#
research.ELEMENTALTOOLS.stage.2=I have drawn up the required rites to infuse the thaumium tools I have created. If my calculations are correct they will have some unique and interesting abilities.<PAGE>§oAxe of the Stream§r<DIV>By combining water shards and a thaumium axe, I have designed a tool that embodies the aspects of motion and flow.<BR>It functions like a normal axe on all materials except natural logs and trees. When used on them the axe finds the furthest block of the same type that is still connected to the block I am attempting to harvest and harvests that one instead.<BR>In effect, I will chop trees from the top down even if I hit the bottom-most block.<BR>Any wood chopped in this fashion will automatically float towards me.<BR>Furthermore, if I press and hold right click the axe will axe will draw all nearby items towards me - not just wood it has chopped.<BR>If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal axe.<PAGE>§oPickaxe of the Core§r<DIV>By infusing a thaumium pickaxe with fire shards, I have designed a pickaxe that glows with the heat of a forge.<BR>When I mine ore blocks there is a chance that I will mine up a cluster instead. Native clusters are much easier to process and produce double the normal amount of metal when smelted.<BR>It can also be used to sound out any surface I right click against to find out what valuable ores can be found nearby.<BR>If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal pickaxe.<PAGE>§oSword of the Zephyr§r<DIV>I have merged the elemental fury of air shards with a thaumium sword.<BR>When used to strike a foe, the blade will sweep in a wide arc, hitting additional foes near my main target.<BR>While blocking the sword will conjure a sphere of whirling winds around me, pushing enemies and loose objects away and deflecting incoming projectiles.<BR>While blocking it will also slowly lift me into the air.<PAGE>§oShovel of the Earthmover§r<DIV>Combining earth shards with a thaumium shovel I have designed a peerless digging implement.<BR>When used to dig earth, sand and similar materials it will dig a 3x3 area.<BR>If I right click on the side of a block, it will attempt to place a 3x3 section of the same material in the world as long as I have sufficient blocks in my inventory.<BR>The orientation of both the digging and construction depends on the face I dug or clicked.<BR>If shift is pressed I can see where blocks will be placed in the world and I can change the orientation of how blocks are placed by pressing the "focus modify" key on the keyboard ('G' by default). Blocks can be placed either parallel to the block face selected, or extending out of the face vertically or horizontally.<BR>If shift is held while using this tool it will no longer dig in a 3x3 pattern.<PAGE>§oHoe of Growth§r<DIV>By merging the magical energy from order and entropy shards with a thaumium hoe, I have created a farming implement with few equals.<BR>When used to till fields, it will till a 3x3 area instead of just a single block.<BR>When used to crops or other plants it will act as bonemeal to promote its growth, though at a higher cost to its durability. It might even be able to grow plants that normal bonemeal can't.<BR>If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal hoe.
#
research.FORTRESSMASK.stage.2=I have drawn up designs for several magical masks that will replace the standard faceplate used by fortress armor.<PAGE>§nHelm of Revealing§r<BR>Usually a thaumaturge needs to choose between protection and utility when out and about. Not anymore!<BR>This modifies a Thaumium Fortress Helm to give it all the functionality of Goggles of Revealing. It does not, however, give the vis discount the goggles usually do.<BR>A helm can have this upgrade along with the other masks.<PAGE>§nGrinning Devil Faceplate§r<BR>When worn, this mask has an interesting damping effect on those suffering from Warp. While it does not reduce the number of events, it does reduce their severity somewhat.<BR>It seems laughing in the face of danger does have its rewards.<PAGE>§nAngry Ghost Faceplate§r<BR>When I am struck in combat while wearing this grim mask the creature striking me has a chance to suffer a Withering effect.<BR>Serves them right.<PAGE>§nSipping Fiend Faceplate§r<BR>When I strike a creature in combat while wearing this mask, I will sometimes steal a small portion of their life force to strengthen my own.<BR>Somehow the fact that I do this by supping on their blood doesn't particularly bother me as much as I would expect. I wonder if I should be worried about that?
#
research.CLOUDRING.stage.1=I should get my feet wet by creating a simple bauble. After some thought I decided to create a ring that will reduce falling damage and maybe even help my mobility.<BR>It should be fairly simple to draw up plans for something like that.
#
research.VERDANTCHARMS.stage.2=I have created designs for a mystical charm that pulses with healing energy that will wash all poisons or similar afflictions from my body. Unfortunately it cannot heal actual wounds.<BR>The charm has an internal store of vis that needs to be charged with a recharge pedestal or similar item - it cannot draw vis from the aura directly.<BR>There are also two specialized enchantments I can apply to the charm to improve its function, though I can only apply one of these enchantments to a given charm.<LINE>§nLifegiver§r<BR>This infusion enchantment allows the Verdant Heart Charm to regenerate the health of whomever wears it.<LINE>§nSustainer§r<BR>This infusion enchantment allows the Verdant Heart Charm to slowly feed and sustain whomever wears it. This includes providing breathable air.

research.REDSTONERELAY.stage.2=I have studied the matter and while it is a well-known phenomenon that redstone inhibits magic, I have discovered that in specific circumstances the opposite can be true as well.<BR>One practical application of this is the Redstone Relay. By sending a redstone signal through a magical substance like vis crystals I can inhibit it as much or as little as I want.<BR>Relays are placed much like redstone repeaters with their output side marked by a redstone torch.<BR>Unlike repeaters, relays have two toggles - the rearmost one determines the minimum input signal required to overwhelm this inhibiting effect and allow the relay to activate.<BR>The front toggle (next to the redstone torch) determines how strong the redstone signal is that the relay will output once it is active.<BR>This way, for example, I could have the relay emit a signal of strength 7 once it receives a signal of at least strength 2.
#
research.DIOPTRA.stage.2=As I expected it was not hard to expand on the workings of the thaumometer to design the Thaumic Dioptra.<BR>This device allows a thaumaturge to see the surrounding aura in a simple and clear manner. It will render the aura in a 13 chunk diameter area around it as a simple height map. It can also be switched to show flux instead by simply clicking on it.<BR>A comparator can be connected if I want to monitor the aura or flux level of the chunk in which it is placed.
#
research.LEVITATOR.stage.2=While not true flight, the Arcane Levitator is the next best thing.<BR>When placed the levitator lifts any item or creature above it up to 8 blocks into the air. A sneaking creature or player will be slowly lowered.<BR>While levitating something it consumes 1 vis per second from the aura.<BR>The levitator can be placed in any orientation, and when placed horizontally will push creatures along while keeping them aloft.<BR>A toggle on the back of the device allows me to alter the range at which it operates, but this also changes the amount of vis it uses.
#
research.INFERNALFURNACE.stage.2=I took a trip to the Nether and was inspired by what I found there. By harnessing the power of §cIgnis§0 with a furnace crafted from obsidian, netherbrick and a pinch of Salis Mundus I can make a highly efficient and fuel-free furnace. So efficient in fact, that occasionally it will produce bonus materials in the form of nuggets, rare earths or other items.<BR>While this is essentially free, it is also very slow unless the furnace gets a steady supply of vis from the aura. It should be noted that the furnace will occasionally create a small amount of flux as well. But I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.<LINE>Anything dropped into the top of the furnace will be smelted down and spit out the front - if the object is not normally smeltable it will be destroyed.<BR>I can place a chest or other container directly in front of the furnace to have it eject items into it.<PAGE>Cooking meat in the infernal furnace will produce meaty chunks as a byproduct. I can combine three different types of these chunks with sugar for a delicious and invigorating treat.
research.INFERNALFURNACE.bellows=Attaching an arcane bellows to an Infernal Furnace has shown some interesting results. The elemental infused air not only stokes the flames increasing its smelting speed, but causes them to burn much purer, increasing the chance of creating bonus nuggets and other materials when smelting.
#
research.MIRROR.stage.1=My thaumonomicon provides some tantalizing hints that mirrors have many mystical uses. One such use is the ability to link physical locations via mirrors through the use of sympathetic magic.<BR>The book does nothing more than provide hints however - as usual I will have to figure out things myself.
research.MIRROR.stage.2=I am now able to enchant a pair of magical mirrors that act as doorways to the void between the worlds. Anything shoved (or piped) through one mirror will pass through this strange realm and emerge from the other mirror - even across dimensional boundaries.<BR>Unfortunately this realm is extremely hostile to mortal creatures like myself so using these mirrors to transport living creatures is not yet possible.<BR>To link a pair of these magical mirrors I first place one of them in a desired location; I then right-click with a second mirror on the one I placed, and the pair will become linked; I may then place the second wherever I wish and items thrown into one will be ejected out the other.<BR>Mirrors can only be linked in pairs, so while both are placed in the world and able to transmit items I cannot link them to another mirror. When I pick up a mirror it will remember the last partner it was linked with, allowing me to easily move it without having to relink it. While one of the paired mirrors is picked up, I may easily relink either of them.<BR>Transporting items through mirrors places stress on the magical aura - every now and again this causes Flux to be generated. The more items I transport, the more flux is generated.
#
research.MIRRORHAND.stage.1=I should find a way of interacting with hand mirrors while out and about. I could carry a linked mirror with me, but that seems terribly inconvenient.
research.MIRRORHAND.stage.2=I have created a magical hand mirror that functions in much the same way as other magical mirrors. I simply push items through the glass and they will pop out at the linked mirror.<BR>Right-clicking while holding the linked hand mirror will let me place any items in my inventory into the glass to transport them to a connected mirror.<BR>The hand mirror can be linked to a mirror that is already paired with another.<BR>I should also note that the hand mirror can only send items, not receive them.
#
research.ARCANELAMP.stage.1=My laboratory seems quite gloomy of late. I should find a way to light it more effectively.
#
research.LAMPGROWTH.stage.1=My studies of Lux have shown me that light can be used as a medium for other helpful magics.<BR>Light already has a positive effect on plants, so if I add some magic to the equation it should only improve things, right?
#
research.LAMPFERTILITY.stage.1=My studies of Lux has shown me that light can be used as a medium for other helpful magics.<BR>Mundane light has been proven to have both positive and negative effects on moods - I think I might be able to greatly improve that effect by adding some arcane flair.
research.LAMPFERTILITY.stage.2=Any living creatures bathed in the gentle pink glow of this lamp are immediately placed in a much more romantic mood. If they are able, they will seek others of their kind to mate.<BR>This lamp will have no effect if there are 8 or more of a particular species already present.<BR>It requires §dDesiderium§0 essentia to function which can be fed to the lamp by attaching it directly to an essentia piping system.<BR>The lamp can be turned off by applying a redstone signal.
#
research.BELLOWS.stage.1=I should start with some simple projects to test my theories. Animating the inanimate is no simple feat.<BR>Stoking furnaces with a bellows increases their heat and smelting speed, but pumping air by hand seems like a perfect waste of my time and talent. Now, if the bellows were able to pump itself that would be a different matter entirely.
research.BELLOWS.stage.2=The Arcane Bellows performs much the same function as its mundane counterpart, the only difference is that it happily pumps away by itself, sending forth a stream of never-ending air.<BR>As I had hoped they can be attached to furnaces to increase their smelting speed.<BR>It is also possible to attach them to crucibles to reduce the time it takes for their water to boil.<BR>Arcane Bellows can be deactivated by applying a redstone signal to them.<BR>I am confident more uses will reveal themselves eventually.
#
research.HUNGRYCHEST.stage.1=I should start with some simple projects to test my theories on animating inanimate objects.<BR>The humble hopper has proven an invaluable tool, but it requires a lot of iron to craft. Sometimes I simply do not have the iron or space to spare for something that (fundamentally) places objects into chests.<BR>But what if chests could gather their own items?
research.HUNGRYCHEST.stage.2=This chest, which I have decided to call a Hungry Chest, will gobble up any loose item that touches it. In effect it functions like a hopper, though it does not output any items it gathers to other inventories.
#
research.ARCANEBORE.stage.1=I need to work out an automated way of digging out large areas. It should be a fairly simple matter to redesign one of my new turrets to target the ground instead of enemies.<BR>My discovery of the break focus effect should allow me to create a specialized and limited version of a caster that can be used by this mining turret.
research.ARCANEBORE.stage.2=I have designed a mining device I am calling the Arcane Bore. Once placed and given a redstone signal it will start digging out an area in front of it. The device requires a pickaxe to be placed inside it, channeled via a simple breaking spell. Normally inanimate objects cannot cast magic, but with a liberal application of sympathetic magic the break spell could be 'tricked' into working.<BR>This had an unforeseen benefit as well - the pickaxe is actually being used to dig on a metaphysical level, so any attributes and enchantments it has are actually applied to the digging process. This does mean the pickaxe will wear out, but much slower than normal - I estimate an average pickaxe will last about 50 times longer.<BR>The size of the area dug is also determined by the material of the pickaxe. The more enchantable the material is, the more efficient the sympathetic magic is, which in turn increases the area that can be dug.<BR>Any blocks dug are ejected at the position of the bore. If there is an inventory adjacent to the bore the items will be placed in there instead.<PAGE>The bore also requires vis to function, consuming 1 vis for every 4 blocks dug.<LINE>The bore can be turned to face any direction except down. To change the direction it faces I simply left-click on it to make it face towards me.<BR>Like other arcane turrets the bore will also respond to arcane activator rails - passing over an inactive rail will switch it on while an active one will disable it.
#
research.GRAPPLEGUN.stage.2=By manipulating magnets with vis, and a few key enchantments, they are able to stick to virtually anything. I am calling this phenomenon Arcanomagnetism. I am sure I will find many uses for this, but for now I have used this knowledge to create the Arcane Grappler.<BR>This launcher fires a brass globe enhanced with arcanomagnets that will attach to any block it comes into contact with. The globe, in turn, is attached to the launcher with a spool of rope that will reel me towards the globe allowing me access to previously inaccessible locations.<BR>I can detach the globe at any point by crouching.<BR>I should take care using the grappler as it does not protect me from falling and it is possible to gain impressive speeds if pulled far enough.<LINE>The grappler requires vis to function and will need to be recharged.
#
research.ARCANEPATTERNCRAFTER.stage.1=Certain objects are very simple to craft - simply place the same type of item in a pattern and I get what I want. For example, combining 2 wood planks to make a stick, or a single ingot to make 9 nuggets. This process is so simple that I am sure there is a way to automate it. I have some theories I need to try.
research.ARCANEPATTERNCRAFTER.stage.2=I have designed a device I am calling the Arcane Pattern Crafter. The Arcane Pattern Crafter needs an inventory above and below it. It will search the inventory above it for components and try to combine whatever it finds in the pattern I have selected. If this results in a valid crafting operation it will place the result in the container below it.<BR>I can change the pattern by clicking on the brass dial on the front of the device.<BR>A redstone signal will disable the device.<LINE>Each crafting operation will drain 1 vis from the aura.
#
research.VISGENERATOR.stage.1=It is a well known fact that vis does not play well with mundane power sources like redstone, redstone flux or forge energy.<BR>The question is: Can I use vis to generate power? The obvious answer is no, but if I settled for the obvious I do not deserve to call myself a thaumaturge.
research.VISGENERATOR.stage.2=One more impossible thing to mark off my list and it's not even lunchtime yet.<BR>I have managed to generate mundane power using vis, though I had to cheat a bit to do it. It is a simple matter to turn kinetic energy into power and creating kinetic energy with vis is thaumaturgy 101. Using vis to turn an axle connected to a dynamo did not work, as some magical energy would transmit through the axle and cause all kinds of problems.<BR>In the end I designed a special linkage using magnets and some clever engineering. This linkage would transmit the kinetic energy while not allowing the vis and mundane energy to interfere with each other.<BR>Unfortunately the nature of the linkage places some limits on the power that can be generated as some kinetic energy is lost. It draws vis directly from the aura to do this and a single point produces 1000 FE/RF, though it can only output 20 FE/RF per tick. <BR>A redstone signal will disable the generator.

# AUROMANCY
##########################################
#
research.BASEAUROMANCY.stage.1=I have the casting glove, but now I need to craft the foci. The old scrolls aren't very clear on how to go about this, so I will need to find my own way.<BR>I have played with the idea of assembling a focus from crystals and then using vis to bind them together. My initial experiments have been failures... explosive failures.<BR>I think the answer I seek lies with an alchemical process.<BR>Using an ordo crystal as a core I might be able to leverage its ordered structure to grow a focus around it. While this is happening it should absorb praecantatio and auram essentia.<BR>The result should hopefully be a crystal focus able to absorb and manipulate vis.
research.BASEAUROMANCY.stage.3=I have everything I need. All I need to do is craft my first focus.<BR>By arranging specially prepared vis crystals around the blank focus I can set up patterns that will determine what function the focus will perform. For now I only know the patterns for §nRoot§0, §nTouch§0 and §nFire§0.<BR>The §nRoot§0 node represents me, the caster. In the focal manipulator interface it is shown as an eye icon. The empty node below it is marked with both a target and a trajectory icon. Mediums (like §nTouch§0) require trajectories to determine what they effect - the §nRoot§0 node provides a trajectory that matches where the caster is looking so by linking §nTouch§0 to it I will be able to 'touch' anything I am looking at. Mediums almost always provide a target (in this case whatever has been 'touched') and some can also provide a trajectory. In this case though I require a target so I will be able to link the §nFire§0 effect.<BR>By linking §nRoot§0, §nTouch§0 and §nFire§0 in this way I will be able to create a focus that applies the §nFire§0 effect to whatever I touch.<BR>I could in theory link §nFire§0 directly to §nRoot§0, but since root provides the caster as a target that means I will simply set myself on fire.<BR>I can fine tune exactly what the §nFire§0 effect does by tweaking its damage and burn duration in the bottom right of the interface. Many patterns will allow me to fine tune them in this way.<BR>Creating a focus require three types of resources - the first is the crystals used in the crafting process, the second is vis from the aura, and lastly it also requires some experience levels. Every time a focus is used it will also consume a small amount of vis from the aura.<PAGE>§nComplexity§0<BR>The effects I can create now are fairly simple and limited. There is a limit to how many patterns I can attach to a focus. This is measured as the focus Complexity. Each pattern type has a complexity cost and increasing their parameters (for example the damage of a fire pattern) will increase the complexity further. Using a pattern more than once also incurs a stacking complexity cost increase of 50%.<BR>The complexity of a focus directly determines how much vis it will cost to cast and how long the caster gauntlet needs to cooldown between casts.
#
research.FOCUSADVANCED.stage.2=By taking a lesser focus and infusing it with the maleability of quicksilver and the complex crystalline structure of diamonds and ender pearls I have created an advanced focus with a lot more internal complexity.
#
research.FOCUSCURSE.stage.2=As I suspected the pech wand is thaumaturgical in nature. However, this discovery leaves me with more questions than answers.<BR>At least I was able to decipher the wands magic into a usable focus pattern. The Curse pattern magically poisons and cripples anything it hits with random maladies. It can even curse the target with a streak of bad luck. Quite nasty and probably devastating if combined with other effects.<BR>Even if it misses, the curse will leave a lasting mark on the world in the form of a corrupting field of energy. This field will eventually fade.
#
research.FOCUSSPELLBAT.stage.2=I have created a medium pattern that conjures an arcane bat and infuses it with focus effects. It will hunt down enemies and repeatedly inflict the focus effects on them.<BR>The bats have limited lifespans, are fragile and each time they attack they also lose some of the vis holding them together.<BR>The bat can be set to target those friendly to me, instead of enemies and neutral creatures.
#
research.FOCUSPROJECTILE.stage.2=I can now place the energy of the focus into a magical projectile that I can hurl at enemies or blocks. The projectile is slow, but I can increase its speed by increasing the complexity.<BR>Further research might allow me to refine these projectiles even further. Studying other kinds of projectiles closely should inspire me. This might involve some personal risk...
research.FOCUSPROJECTILE.stage.3=I have discovered methods to improve the utility of projectile even further!<LINE>§nBouncy§0<BR>When this projectile hits a solid surface it will bounce off. This projectile cannot effect blocks anymore as it will simply bounce off any block it hits.<BR>§nSeek Hostiles§0<BR>Projectiles with this special property will automatically redirect their flight path towards hostile targets ahead of them.<BR>§nSeek Friendlies§0<BR>Similar to Seek Hostiles, this projectile will seek out friendly targets.
#
research.FOCUSBOLT.stage.1=Hurling magical projectiles is a chore sometimes. They are hard to aim and take time to travel to the intended target.<BR>Maybe there is a way I can extend the functionality of the the Touch medium?
research.FOCUSBOLT.stage.2=Who needs projectiles when I can hurl bolts of magical energy? They affect their target instantly and aiming them is a lot easier.<BR>Unfortunately their range is limited; trying to keep the vis stream coherent beyond 16 blocks has proven difficult. Therefore, for longer range engagements projectiles are still superior.
#
research.FOCUSFLUX.title=Focus Effect: Flux
research.FOCUSFLUX.stage.1=Using the elements as a weapon has its benefits, but raw magic can be just as destructive - most creatures are harmed if exposed to raw, unfiltered vis. Even armor cannot protect one from this energy.
#
research.FOCUSEXCHANGE.stage.2=My theory has proven correct! By applying this pattern to a focus I can use it to select a type of block in the world. I simply need to sneak while right-clicking on it.<BR>When I then cast the effect on most other blocks it will exchange the target block for the one I selected earlier. Obviously I must be carrying enough of the selected blocks for the exchange to happen and the targeted block (or what it normally drops when broken) will appear in my inventory.<BR>It seems I cannot exchange particularly complex blocks, or those that cannot be broken by normal means.<BR>Apart from the cost to cast it, it seems the vis cost is also subtracted for each block exchanged in this way. I should be cautious.
#
research.FOCUSRIFT.stage.1=I have performed a few tentative experiments with dimensional magic. Thus far I have had mixed results, but I am able to reliably shift inanimate matter into an adjacent reality while part of that reality shifts into ours. I think.<BR>Either way, the matter returns unharmed almost every time. Living matter is a different matter - I dare not pen what I saw and I doubt I will attempt that experiment again.<BR>Luckily I think I will be able to replicate this discovery in the form a focus effect.
research.FOCUSRIFT.stage.2=I have managed to create a focus that manipulates dimensional magic. Most inanimate objects will be shifted into this other realm temporarily, creating a kind of "portable hole".<BR>The diameter of this hole will remain fixed at around 3 yards, but I should be able to manipulate the depth quite a bit.
#
research.FOCUSPLAN.stage.1=I have learned to manipulate blocks in the world with focus effects such as Exchange, but their practical use is a bit limited.<BR>I should discover a way to fine tune exactly which blocks I can apply such focus effects to.
research.FOCUSPLAN.stage.2=I have designed a medium pattern that will allow me to plan which blocks I manipulate. This medium works much like Touch, except I will be shown a ghostly outline of which blocks will be manipulated. The range is also much greater (16 blocks). By pressing the focus modify key ('G' by default) I can alter the size of the area. By pressing CTRL + G I can alter the axis in which the size will be changed.<BR>This medium has two modes of operation which I can select between when I add it to a focus: Full and Surface. Full mode affects all possible blocks that match the size, while surface mode will only affect blocks that have an exposed side.<BR>This focus medium cannot be used in combination with any other mediums.
#
research.FOCUSSCATTER.stage.1=I now know how to create both projectiles and bolts that propagate focus effects. I believe it should be fairly simple to design a plan that allows me to split a single trajectory into multiple.
research.FOCUSSCATTER.stage.2=I have managed to split a single medium trajectory into multiple, though not quite to the degree I had hoped. There are two problems:<BR>Firstly is that while I can control the number of forks created from the original trajectory, I have no control over the resulting trajectories once it is split. It simply scatters them in random directions. Fortunately I have figured out how to limit the cone of scatter.<BR>The second problem is that the more forks I create, the weaker the individual effects are. This is not surprising - there is only so much vis I can channel. I can mitigate this slightly by drawing in additional vis to bolster the effects, but each resulting fork is still weaker than the original.<BR>This modifier can only be used once in a single focus.
#
research.FOCUSSPLIT.stage.2=I have managed to draw up designs for two new focus modifiers. The first splits a single target result into two, allowing me to have two different effects applied to the target.<BR>The second modifier does the same, except it splits trajectories.<BR>The only downside is that the split reduces the power of any effects placed below them, though I can mitigate the full impact somewhat by strengthening those effects.<BR>Much to my surprise I have discovered that these modifiers can be split recursively, allowing for some interesting focus designs.
#
research.FOCUSMINE.stage.1=I have done some studies into creating constructs of pure arcane energy recently. Maybe I can apply what I have learned?
research.FOCUSMINE.stage.2=I can now create a quasi-physical construct of vis that can hold focus effects in stasis until triggered. When created, this 'mine' takes two seconds to arm. Once it is armed, any non-allied entity that gets close enough will cause the mine to trigger, releasing the stored effects towards the triggering entity.<BR>The mine can be set to trigger on friendlies instead of enemies and neutral creatures.
#
research.FOCUSCLOUD.stage.1=Seeing the lingering effects the ender dragon's breath causes has given me some ideas. I might be able to duplicate these clouds as a focus medium.
research.FOCUSCLOUD.stage.2=Much like lingering potions can be used to create a static effect in the world, the Cloud medium can be used to create a field of energy that periodically applies focus effects to creatures and blocks caught within.<BR>The strength of effects linked to this medium will be reduced significantly, however.
#
research.RECHARGEPEDESTAL.stage.1=I expect that I will soon begin crafting objects that require vis to function, but that cannot easily draw vis from the aura themselves. I will need a way to recharge them.
research.RECHARGEPEDESTAL.stage.2=This specially crafted pedestal can recharge vis storing items. Any rechargeable item placed in it will draw vis from the aura to fill itself. I simply have to click on the pedestal with the item I wish to recharge. To retrieve the item, I have to click the pedestal again.
#
research.VISAMULET.stage.1=If I wish to recharge my vis storage items I currently need to return to the nearest recharge pedestal or carry one of them around. This is not always convenient however - I must find a portable way to recharge my items.
research.VISAMULET.stage.2=I have crafted an amulet capable of channeling vis from the aura, allowing me to recharge items in the field while it is worn.<BR>The amulet will only recharge items located in my hotbar, baubles or armor slots (in that order). It will only recharge items that can normally be recharged in a recharge pedestal.
#
research.VISBATTERY.stage.2=I have succeeded in creating a vis battery.<BR>If the local aura is above 95% of its normal capacity the battery will absorb vis, and if the aura drops below 75% it will discharge.<BR>There are a few drawbacks however. While it is quicker and a lot more reliable than natural vis crystals, the battery still takes some time to react to changes in the local aura. The second drawback is its capacity: it can only store 10 points of vis, and my attempts to increase this have proven disastrous. I suppose this means that I will need to use them in larger numbers.<BR>Applying a redstone signal to the battery will not only prevent it from functioning, but it will rapidly discharge any vis it is holding back into the aura.
#
research.BASICTURRET.stage.1=A few attacks from wandering monsters have recently turned my mind towards home defense. I should design some sort of automated device that will defend my home from unwanted intruders. 
research.BASICTURRET.stage.2=I have found a way to give a crossbow a mind of its own, turning it into a simple automated turret.<BR>When placed in the world it will automatically fire at any hostile monsters it detects within range. Unfortunately its limited mind does not allow me to fine tune its targets.<BR>It has a very limited internal inventory, but if I place it over an upward facing dispenser it will automatically reload itself from that inventory.<BR>Right clicking on it while sneaking will pick it up.<PAGE>The turret can ride in a minecart, and will reload from a dispenser placed underneath the track.<BR>Passing over an arcane activator rail will change the behaviour of the turret; if the rail is active it will disable the turret, and passing over an inactive rail will enable it again.
research.f_DISPENSER.text=Examine something that can launch objects
#
research.ADVANCEDTURRET.stage.2=The Advanced Automated Crossbow works much like its basic counterpart, with a few significant improvements.<BR>The addition of iron plating makes it much sturdier, and a more complicated loading mechanism gives it a greater rate of fire.<BR>Lastly, I can now specify the type of targets it can attack.
#

#
research.JARBRAIN.stage.2=I have discovered a way to reanimate a zombie brain and put it to my own dark uses.<BR>It retains some of the hunger it possessed as a zombie and while it cannot consume brains, it still enjoys eating the thoughts and experiences of those slain nearby. Giving the jar a good shake will make it surrender some of its ill-gotten gains for my own use.<BR>It will only hold a certain amount of experience - particle effects will be displayed above the jar when it is full.<BR>This jar can also be used to a much greater effect than bookcases do to improve a mundane enchanting table.
research.f_BRAIN.text=Examine something brainy.
#
research.MATSTUDCLAY.stage.1=Clay is not particularly strong, light or durable, but it is easy to work, highly resistant to fire and lighter than iron.<BR>It's the perfect choice for a thaumaturge on a budget.
#
research.MATSTUDBRASS.stage.1=While brass is softer than iron, it is still quite sturdy and well-suited to fine mechanical constructs.<BR>It may very well be the best mundane material for Golemancy purposes, and I would not dream of crafting intricate devices from any other material.<BR>It is quite pleasing to the eye as well.
#
research.MATSTUDTHAUMIUM.stage.1=Thaumium is an arcane metal that sucks up enchantments like a proverbial sponge. It is significantly stronger than iron too. Unfortunately it is slightly heavier than iron and its strength also makes it hard to work.<BR>While it cannot compete with brass when it comes to intricate clockwork, thaumium's strength makes it a useful material to craft mechanisms that require strength over precision.
#
research.MATSTUDVOID.stage.1=Void metal is relatively light but quite soft, which would normally make it an unsuitable material for mechanisms. Luckily, its morphic properties and ability to self-repair opens up interesting possibilities for a thaumaturge willing to think outside the box.
#
research.MINDCLOCKWORK.stage.1=Iron golems, snow golems and similar creations that anyone can throw together all have the same thing in common - they are unpredictable and uncontrollable.<BR>The spirits that animate them are wild and follow their own will. This is a problem.<BR>If I am going to create intelligent magical servants then I will have to give them minds that are willing to take orders. The simplest solution is a clockwork construct quickened by Thaumaturgy.<BR>Designing one will be no simple feat, however.
research.MINDCLOCKWORK.stage.3=I have designed a special press that will allow me to craft simple golems. It includes an anvil and forge to make assembling the parts easier.<LINE>To assemble a golem I simply need to access the Golem Press and select the components I wish to craft the golem from. For now the selection is fairly limited, but I am sure I will develop more.<PAGE>Actually designing a golem is fairly straightforward: Each golem is made up from up to 5 components: The base material, a type of head, arms, legs and an optional addon module. I simply select which of these I want to use and a list of crafting components will be displayed on the right. I need to have the listed components in my inventory before I can start the crafting process.<BR>Listed in the middle of the interface I will see the traits, hearts, armor and damage the golem will possess.<BR>Lastly, I will need to supply Machina essentia to the press. Several ports are provided below the main press mechanism for this purpose.<PAGE>With a golem made, I can now place it wherever I wish, but it will not do much unless I also place down a §5Golem Control Seal§0. I have detailed these in a separate research entry.<BR>When they have no tasks to perform, golems will return to the spot they were originally placed. I can pick up a golem by right clicking on it while sneaking.<BR>It is also possible to assign a color to a golem by clicking on it with dye, which is useful for limiting it to specific seals. Picking up a golem will clear any color assigned to it.
#
research.CONTROLSEALS.stage.1=Golems cannot do anything they are not told to do. For this purpose I have created Control Seals. I can place these circular clay seals against almost any surface I wish. Once I do they will become become ethereal and intangible, but I will still be able to see them as long as I hold a golem, another seal or a §5Golemancer's Bell§0.<BR>The bell is an important tool as it is used to fine tune the settings and parameters of the control seals.<BR>Since seals are ethereal I can place down another block in the same spot as a placed seal.<BR>Several seals can also occupy the same block space as long as they are located on different faces of a block. This should allow me to keep things quite compact.<BR>I can retrieve a seal by holding shift and right-clicking on it with the bell.<PAGE>Clicking on a seal with the bell will allow me to tweak its parameters. The exact parameters will vary from seal to seal, but most seals will allow me to give them a priority between -5 and +5 (the default being 0). Tasks are created by seals and transmitted to nearby golems, with higher priority seals having their tasks performed first. I can see a list of required traits that a golem will need to have in order to perform tasks created by that seal.<BR>For example, a seal might require a golem to have the §5Deft§0 trait, or perhaps another seal will require that a golem §onot§r have the §5Clumsy§0 trait.<BR>For a practical example, look at the §5Collect Seal§0.<LINE>Seals can be set to become inactive when they receive a redstone signal. All queued or in progress tasks from that seal will also be removed.<BR>It is also possible to assign a color to a seal. If I do so, tasks from that seal will only be performed by uncolored golems or golems with the same color. Uncolored seals will assign tasks to all golems (colored and uncolored alike).<BR>I can set seal colors in the same place where I set priorities.<BR>I can assign a golem a color by using a dye on it; this color will be cleared if the golem is picked up.
#
research.GOLEMDIRECT.stage.1=Having golems mindlessly following seals is not my only goal - I want them to mindlessly follow me as well.<BR>There has to be a way to make that happen.
research.GOLEMDIRECT.stage.2=I can now right-click on a golem with the §5Golemancer's Bell§0 to have it follow me. While following me, it will no longer obey seals and combat-capable golems will defend me in combat.<BR>Clicking on the golem again will return it to normal functioning, and its home location will be set to its current location; perfect for moving golems without picking them up and placing them back down.
#
research.GOLEMLOGISTICS.stage.1=Having created the Provider Seal, I now have an interesting opportunity. It should be possible for me to directly request items from nearby golems.<BR>Some tweaking to their pathfinding will be required, but it should not be too hard to achieve.
research.GOLEMLOGISTICS.stage.2=I can now sneak + right click with the §5Golemancer's Bell§0 to bring up an inventory of all items accessible by provider seals within 32 blocks. I can then request items from this list and a golem will deliver it to me.<BR>If I clicked on a block the item will be delivered to that block, or placed inside it if it's an inventory. The side I clicked on will be taken into account here.<BR>If I clicked on empty air the item will be delivered directly to me.<PAGE>Golems are still limited by their range so I must take care where I try and deliver items to.
#
research.MINDBIOTHAUMIC.stage.1=As predicted, the Clockwork Minds I have created offer very little in the way of abstract reasoning and autonomy. Attempting to create more complex clockworks has met with very little success, so I am turning to something I already know will work: living brains.<BR>By studying them, I might be able to unlock the secret behind true intelligence and autonomy!
research.MINDBIOTHAUMIC.stage.2=Though hesitant at first, I soon overcame any trepidation I felt and delved into Biothaumaturgy - merging flesh, machines and magic into a single whole.<BR>The results are encouraging and I am now able to infuse clockwork minds with salvaged gray matter to form a mind with much greater capabilities.<BR>This has also allowed me to create more complex versions of seals I already know.<BR>Another advantage of this type of mind is that it will allow a golem to learn. As it completes tasks it will gain experience and rank up; higher ranks grant a golem additional health, speed and damage.<BR>Golems start at rank 0 and can improve up to rank 10.<BR>Golems will retain their rank if picked up.
#
research.SEALCOLLECT.stage.ADV=I can now craft an advanced version of this seal that allows for filtering more items at once. It also gives greater control over how the items are filtered, though golems need to be much smarter to perform tasks created by this seal.<BR>I can choose to have the seal ignore NBT or damage values when filtering items, or use the ore dictionary, or even have the seal filter items from the same mod as those included in the filter.
#
research.SEALSTORE.stage.1=This seal can be placed on the side of a container. It will designate the container as a possible destination for any items that golems nearby happen to be holding. As long as the container can accept it, the golems will deliver the item.<BR>I can filter out certain items using a white- or blacklist.<BR>For the whitelist I can also specify a specific number of items that must be placed in the inventory. By default this number is infinite (marked with a gold star).<BR>If placed against a non-container block the golem will simply drop items at that location.<BR>Like with inventories I can also specify a specific number of items with the whitelist. Any items located in the world within a 1 block radius of the seal will be counted.
research.SEALSTORE.stage.ADV=I can now craft an advanced version of the seal that will allow me to filter more items at once and which gives me greater control over how the items are filtered, though golems need to be much smarter to perform tasks created by this seal.<BR>I can choose to have the seal ignore NBT or damage values when filtering items, use the ore dictionary, or to have it filter items from the same mod as those in the filter.<BR>If I specify item counts in the whitelist, then all items that match the filter with these settings will be counted.
#
research.SEALEMPTY.stage.2=This seal is effectively the opposite of the Store seal: it will empty items from the inventory it is attached to. Any nearby golems will simply take the items and hold them, so I will need to use other seals to give them instructions as to what they need to do with the items they have taken.<BR>A specific item can be filtered so it is removed, or excluded from removal.
research.SEALEMPTY.stage.ADV=I can now craft an advanced version of the seal that will allow me to filter more items at once and which gives me greater control over how the items are filtered, though golems need to be much smarter to perform tasks created by this seal.<BR>I can choose to have the seal ignore NBT or damage values when filtering items, use the ore dictionary, or to have it filter items from the same mod as those in the filter.<BR>I can also have the seal only check for a single item in the filter at a time in the order they are listed.
#
research.SEALPROVIDE.stage.2=This seal is similar to the Empty seal, except it will only remove an item from the inventory if there is a specific need for it.<BR>Certain seals may request provisioning. If they require specific items for their tasks a secondary task will be created telling a nearby golem to retrieve those items from any inventories marked with a Provide seal.<BR>This task will use the requesting seal's priority, and the golem needs to meet the requirements for both the Provider seal and the requesting seal.<BR>The filter on the Provide seal is merely used to compare what items may be taken from the container. The filters (if any) on the requesting seal will determine the exact item taken.
#
research.SEALHARVEST.stage.2=This seal will search the designated area for any fully-grown crops or other harvestable plants. Once found, a golem will be dispatched to harvest the plant.<BR>If required, the seal will also attempt to replant the harvested crop as long as seeds (or similar items) are available. If the seed was previously planted on farmland and the soil has turned into dirt, the golem will also try to till the dirt back into farmland.
#
research.SEALBREAK.stage.2=This seal commands golems to break any blocks they find in the area.<BR>The hardness of a block determines how quickly it can be broken.<BR>It is possible to filter the type of blocks to be broken or ignored.<BR>It should be noted that due to factors like golem mobility, limited area, and speed, this seal probably will not make a very effective mining tool, though it could probably be used as such in a pinch.
research.SEALBREAK.stage.ADV=I can now craft an advanced version of the seal that will allow me to filter more items at once and allow the golem to break blocks as if they are using Silk Touch.<BR>Golems will take longer to break block if Silk Touch is used. 
#
research.SEALLUMBER.stage.1=While the §5Block Breaker§0 seal can be used to chop down trees, it is not particularly effective at the task. I should do something about that.

research.SEALUSE.title=Control Seal: Use
research.SEALUSE.stage.1=I should be able to design a seal that allows golems to interact with the world in more complex ways than simply carrying items around or attacking things. There are many objects that require manual operation, so maybe I can have golems operate them for me.
#
research.SEALSTOCK.stage.2=This seal is similar to the store seal, except it keeps a certain number of items stocked inside its container at all times. The seal only ensures that a minimum number of items are kept in stock - it will not prevent overstocking should it occur by other means.<BR>This seal requires provider seals to know where to get the items.
#
research.GOLEMFLYER.stage.2=By essentially chopping off a golem's legs and gluing an Arcane Levitator in their place, I have managed to get a golem to fly! This grants it good, if slightly erratic mobility, though it does move more slowly.<BR>§9This research unlocks additional golem parts§0.
research.f_FLY.text=Closely examine a flying creature
#
research.GOLEMBREAKER.title=Golem Manipulation: Block Breaking
research.GOLEMBREAKER.stage.2=By replacing a golem's arms with a set of powerful, diamond-tipped pneumatic grinders it will be able to break through all but the hardest materials.<BR>§9This research unlocks additional golem parts.§0
#
research.GOLEMCOMBATADV.title=Improved Golem Combat
research.GOLEMCOMBATADV.stage.2=I can now craft specialized golem weaponry and armor to make them much more effective in combat.<BR>§9This research unlocks additional golem parts.§0

research.BASEELDRITCH.stage.1=The void seed I have discovered begs further study. I should study it further and perhaps discover a practical use for it.<BR>Currently it seems morphically unstable - its physical properties are constantly shifting and changing. Maybe binding it with something else will make it easier to manipulate. Metal perhaps?
research.BASEELDRITCH.stage.2=My hand shakes as I write this. The strange substance I have investigated has opened strange new vistas in my mind.<BR>Before me I have formulas for creating a mysterious new metal, yet I do not remember writing them, nor does the handwriting look quite like mine.<BR>The metal they describe is a mass of contradictions. It is hard and unyielding, yet at the same time soft and easy to work. It will feel warm to the touch, almost alive, and like living things it will slowly heal itself if damaged.<BR>Crafting mere physical tools from this seems almost... wrong.
#
research.VOIDSIPHON.stage.2=I hate to admit it, but the Crimson Cult might be on to something. I have managed to design a Void Siphon that slowly leaches energy from nearby rifts. This leached energy will slowly form into Void Seeds. The larger the rift is, the quicker this process occurs.<BR>Unfortunately this is not without consequence for the rift itself. The rift will become increasingly unstable and will slowly shrink as its energy is leached away. I must take care to not overuse them.<BR>A redstone signal will disable the Void Siphon.
#
research.VOIDSEERPEARL.stage.2=When I hold this charm I get glimpses of what lies beyond. The meaning still eludes me, but I feel more connected to the aura and magic than I have ever felt before.<BR>While I have this charm equipped I find vis much easier to manipulate.<BR>Oddly enough, the size of the bonus seems to be proportional to the amount of permanent warp I have suffered. What a strange coincidence.
#
research.VOIDROBEARMOR.stage.2=Using the knowledge I have gained thus far, I have designed a set of armored robes that combines the utility of Thaumaturge's Robes with the practicality of Thaumium Fortress Armor.<BR>Primarily made from void metal, this armor has all the benefits (and side-effects) that metal offers.<BR>Lastly, the hood of the robes contain integrated Goggles of Revealing.<BR>This armor can be dyed.
#
research.PRIMALCRUSHER.stage.1=The variable and malleable nature of Void Metal has opened up some interesting possibilities.<BR>I believe it should be possible to create a tool with inherent morphic instability. In other words: it will constantly fluctuate between various states so rapidly that it might not be visible to the naked eye.
research.PRIMALCRUSHER.stage.2=Success! I have created a tool I am calling the Primal Crusher. It has the essential nature of both a pickaxe and a shovel. It does not look like either of those tools, but it definitely functions like them. Better in fact. It is also surprisingly effective against Taint.<BR>It is slightly unpleasant to hold however - it seems to vibrate in one's hand and the feeling becomes quite uncomfortable after a while. A little discomfort will not stop me from using it, however.
